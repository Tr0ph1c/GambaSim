# Gamba Sim

## Description
- I initially made this game to practice my C++ coding skills. It's a terminal game with no GUI nor TUI ( I might integrate TUI later ).
The game is a strategy based game with elements of luck. It is a "gambling" simulator where you buy, sell, and open cases for chances
to make profits or lose them over the course of your runs. You can set highscores, try different strategies and approaches to play the
game, and explore the content that the game provides. You can also skip all that and just look in the code if you are interested :).

## How to build
- The game can be built for both Windows and Linux you just need GCC and Make.
- __*Step by step:*__
- git clone the repo
- `cd GambaSim`
- `make`
- `./gamba` or `gamba` for windows
